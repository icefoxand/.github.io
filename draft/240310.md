I like my neighnborhood - bcuz it's a quiet and convenient place to live

i live in an apartment complex near the downtown area

although it's close to downtown, my town is pretty quiet

i use public transportation to get around

the only person i talk to in my town is hyoju kim who lives next to me.

we run into each other about once a week

we usually hava a conversation - when we both get into the elevator

it's not about 어쩌구, it's about 저쩌구...

oh? you wanna know about my place?
